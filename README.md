# How To Use CsyonSubMenu Script
For every Version of the CsyonSubMenu YimMenu there is a different use and ways to fully Run It. 

For YimMenu it is actually the same way, but first before initiating the script you will need to go to Settings > Lua > Open Folder Option 

From There Go To Scripts Folder Then Paste The CsyonSubMenu In There

## When Your New Updates Will Be Out?
No ETA for big updates also because i don't know actually if im going to be able to continue this script because i have a life and i need to study. This is a helpfull and fun project for everyone who wants to use it, is free and you can use my script as a template.
